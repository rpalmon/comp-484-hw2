TASK: b. Open the structure.html file and explore the page structure and ARIA roles. Write out the document outline, and how structural tags like aside, article, nav, and section are being used.

DOCUMENT OUTLINE:
The page has a structure starting with "Comp 484" as the main heading (H1), followed by "Structuring Pages" as a secondary heading (H2). Under that are four main topics at the same level (H3): "Conveying meaning through structure", "Sectioning elements", "Document outlines", and "WAI-ARIA Roles". Within the "Document outlines" section, there is a W3C Warning box with a sub-heading (H4).

STRUCTURAL TAGS AND HOW THEY ARE USED:

Article Element:
The article element wraps all the educational content about HTML structure. It contains everything from the introduction through the WAI-ARIA discussion. This tag shows the content is complete on its own.

Section Elements:
There are three section elements in this document. The first section talks about "Sectioning elements" and explains HTML5 structural tags. The second section covers "Document outlines" and explains the HTML outline algorithm. The third section discusses "WAI-ARIA Roles" and explains accessibility features. Each section represents a different topic within the article.

Navigation Element:
The nav element appears in the page header and contains a list of links to all the main pages on the site (Introduction to HTML, HTML syntax, Structuring pages, Creating links, HTML reference, and Next steps). This helps users move between different pages on the website.

Aside Element:
The aside element is inside the second section about document outlines. It contains a W3C warning that provides extra information about the HTML5 outline algorithm. This content adds to the main discussion but isn't required for understanding the main message. The aside has a heading and a quoted warning message.

SEMANTIC ELEMENTS AND ARIA ROLES:

Header with banner role - This identifies the top section of the page that contains the site title, page title, and navigation. Screen readers recognize this as the main header area.

Navigation with navigation role - This landmark helps assistive technology users quickly find the navigation menu.

Main with main role - This identifies the main content area of the page, making it easy for users to skip to the main content.

Footer with contentinfo role - This identifies the footer area containing contact information and links.

PAGE STRUCTURE OVERVIEW:
The page starts with a header containing the site branding and navigation. Below that is the main content area with an article that has an intro header followed by three topic sections. One of those sections contains an aside element with extra information. At the bottom is a footer with contact and institutional information.



SEMANTIC TAGS USAGE ANALYSIS:

Header Element:
The <header> element appears twice in this document:
1. Page header (with role="banner") - Contains the site title "Comp 484", page title "Structuring Pages", and main navigation menu. This is the main header for the whole page and provides the same branding and navigation across the site.
2. Article header - Contains the intro content for the article with the "Conveying meaning through structure" heading and explanation paragraph. This header introduces the article content.

Main Element:
The <main> element (with role="main") wraps the main content of the page. It contains the entire article about HTML structure and helps identify the main content area. This helps users with screen readers skip directly to the main content, going past navigation and other extra elements. There should only be one main element per page, and it contains the content that is directly related to what the page is about.

Footer Element:
The <footer> element (with role="contentinfo") appears at the bottom of the page and contains contact information and school details (CSUN address). This provides the same site-wide information and helps users find contact details and legal information.

BENEFITS:
These HTML elements create clear page sections that improve accessibility, allow for better CSS styling without needing class names, and help search engines understand the page structure. Using HTML5 elements with ARIA roles provides the best support for assistive technologies.

      <h3> Conveying meaning through structure </h3>
      <p>Creating properly structured pages is the foundation of any good website. A solid semantic structure allows you to convey meaning and properly represent content types through nothing more than the page's markup. This, in turn, makes your content more accessible, easier to index and search, and makes it easier to repurpose. Remember that there are a lot of different devices, robots, and other user agents that will be reading your code. <em>Without a consistent, semantic structure your site will be less effective.</em> </p>
    </header>
    <section>
      <h3>Sectioning elements </h3>
      <p>One way to add meaning to your content is to organize them into sections that convey meaning and structure. For example it's pretty standard to contain introductory information within a section, page navigation within its own area, the page's main content in its own region, and related information within a sidebar. HTML contains numerous elements that are designed to assist in the logical structuring and semantics of page content. </p>
      <p>In previous versions of HTML creating new sections of content was done almost exclusively through the use of <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html51/sections.html#the-h1,-h2,-h3,-h4,-h5,-and-h6-elements" title="heading elements"><b>heading</b></a> tags, with <b>divs</b> being used to group areas of content together. <b>Class</b> or <b>ID</b> attributes would allow designers to attach more semantic meaning to the groups, although this meant little to most user agents. In HTML5 new sectioning and semantic elements were introduced to help represent commonly used sections and create more consistent page structures. Tags like the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html51/sections.html#the-aside-element" title="aside element"><b>aside</b></a>, <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html51/sections.html#the-article-element" title="article element"><b>article</b></a>, <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html51/sections.html#the-footer-element" title="footer element"><b>footer</b></a>, <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html51/sections.html#the-header-element" title="header element"><b>header</b></a>, <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html51/grouping-content.html#the-main-element" title="main element"><b>main</b></a>, <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html51/sections.html#the-nav-element" title="nav element"><b>nav</b></a>, and <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html51/sections.html#the-section-element" title="section element"><b>section</b></a> allow authors to identify common page regions and convey more semantic meaning. </p>
      <p>Although some of these elements are very specific, in many cases which element you'll use and how you'll structure them is very much a judgment call. Make sure, however, that your finished structure represents the desired document outline. </p>

      <h3>Document outlines </h3>
      <p>One of the fundamental concepts of HTML is that its documents can be represented by a document outline that summarizes the content of the page. Imagine a page being represented by a table of contents and you'll have a good idea of what one of these outlines might look like. These outlines assist in tasks such as quickly searching documents and making content easier to navigate for assistive devices. </p>
      <p>Prior to HTML5, document outlines were generated entirely through the use of headings. An H1 at the top of the page would serve to identify the page content, and subsequent headings would create sections and subsections inside of it. This meant that having a strategy for when to use certain headings was critical for maintaining consistent document structure. In HTML5 a new outline algorithm was introduced that added the new sectioning elements to the heading elements and created a more sophisticated outlining model. Although not currently implemented by user agents it is still recommended that authors familiarize themselves with it so that they're using the new sectioning and semantic tags properly. </p>
      <p>It is still considered to be a best practice to use heading tags to establish the document outline. Mozilla has a fantastic article on <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Sections_and_Outlines_of_an_HTML5_document" title="Mozilla Dev article on HTML sections">sections and outlines</a> in HTML documents that I strongly recommend reading.</p>

        <h4>W3C Warning</h4>
        <p>At the time of the authoring of this course, the W3C had posted this warning regarding the HTML5 outline algorithm:</p>
        <blockquote>There are currently no known implementations of the outline algorithm in graphical browsers or assistive technology user agents, although the algorithm is implemented in other software such as conformance checkers. Therefore the outline algorithm cannot be relied upon to convey document structure to users. Authors are advised to use heading rank (h1-h6) to convey document structure.</blockquote>

      <h3>WAI-ARIA Roles</h3>
      <p>Carefully structuring an HTML page is the first step into ensuring that the content is accessible to all users. You should also use WAI-ARIA role attributes where appropriate to increase accessibility and improve semantics. WAI-ARIA is short for the Web Accessibility Initiative's Accessible Rich Internet Application specification. The roles attribute attempts to identify content and its capabilities by assigning it to a predefined role. This helps assistive devices understand what the content is, how it relates to other content, and how the content can be interacted with. The W3C has a <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2014/WD-aria-in-html-20140626/" title="Using WAI-ARIA in HTML">fantastic resource</a> on how WAI-ARIA works and how it should be used with HTML.</p>
